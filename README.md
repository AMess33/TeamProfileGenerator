## A Node application that creates an Employee Team Roster

This application is used to create a team roster in a working enviornment. A Manager is the head of the team and is the first employee created by the application. Once you input the Manager's info you are given the option to add an Engineer and/or an Intern to your team roster. Once you enter the info for the next employee you are directed back to the main menu where you can choose to coninue adding to the team roster or exit the application. When you exit the application an HTML page is created that shows your entire team and the necessary info input into the application on a webpage. 

- I wanted to see all members of the Development team and their important contact information on a webpage.
- I built this project to gain experience with Test Driven Development as well as Object Oriented Programing.
- This application will allow anyone in the company to see all members of the Development team and their contact info on one webpage.
- While creating this application I learned how to write tests and code that fulfills the requirements of the tests.


## Usage

When you run node index.js within the terminal you will be prompted with questions that about the Manager of your team. Once you answer the first set of questions about the Manager, you will be asked to add members to the team. If you choose to add an Engineer, you will be asked 3 questions relevent to the Engineer position. Once you have answered the Engineer questions you will be taken back to the menu prompt and again asked to add members to your team. If you select add Intern, you will be prompted with 3 relevent questions about your Intner and then return to the menu. When you are done creating your roster of employees and you select 'Finished adding employees', the application will create an Index.HTML file and you can launch the file in a web browser and see the team Roster on a webpage.
